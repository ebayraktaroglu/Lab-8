# Lab 8 - Checking Understanding
1. I think the best way to do automated tests for the Recipe project development pipeline would be to do them within a Github actions whenever code is pushed. This is because doing it manually before pushing the code is basically the same as the automated tests, but it takes more effort on your part, and you could forget to do it. Also, running them after all development is completed is bad because then it will be very hard to debug after you've written a bunch of code and the error(s) could be anywhere.
2. I would not use end to end testing to check if a function is returning the correct output, because it is not connected to anything outside itself, so it could be easily tested on its own without running the entire program.
